# ESP8266_Temperature_Logger
DS18b20 Temperature Sensor and Wifi upload to a host to log temperature

A simple example of reading the temperature using the Arduino libraries and logging it to a web site.

I have built a bunch of these for different purposes. The web host software handles notifications, sms messages, graphing
and any other use needed.

The DS18b20 is waterproof enough to have spent over a year underwater in the lake recording the lake temperature. One was lost during a thunderstorm due to a nearbly lightning strike. The ESP board was also fried and the power adapter.

The condo version has reported the condo air temperature for months on end with no glitches to provide evidence that the
air conditioning does not work properly.
